This chatbot is designed to help CSUMB students get questions and information about the available educational abroad opportunities that CSUMB offers. The school website does not have a chatbot, 
and we thought it would be useful to have one. We integrated an openAI key, so we could control and prompt how our chatbot interacted with students. Included is a feature that allows the student 
to export the conversation as a pdf (a feature that openAI requires premium account to have access to).
