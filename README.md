This chatbot is designed to help CSUMB students get questions and information about the available educational abroad opportunities that CSUMB offers. The school website does not have a chatbot, 
and we thought it would be useful to have one. We integrated an openAI key, so we could control and prompt how our chatbot interacted with students. Included is a feature that allows the student 
to export the conversation as a pdf (a feature that openAI requires premium account to have access to).

This project could be taken further by actually coding an extension that would allow students to plan, budget, and orchestrate their education abroad without having to meet with an advisor. 
Much of the meetings with advisors could be completed with a GPT and programming.

BONUS: Integrate scholarship applications and GPT essay coach to tailor applications with students goals.
